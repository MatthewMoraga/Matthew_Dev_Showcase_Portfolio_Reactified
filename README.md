## Description
My portfolio website that shows my work

## Usage
```
When a user visits my website they are greeted with an about page that tells a little bit about myself and my profecencies.
Then the user can navigate to the project page which shows some of my work
Then the user can navigate to the resume page to see my resume which is pretty basic atm.
Then the user can naviaget to the contact page where they can send me an email.
```

## Future Development
```
Writing more about me,
adding more to my resume and actually have an actual resume to download.
making the form functional one day. I left my email there in the meantime.
better responsiveness
I tried to use vanilla css with react to see how I did. It's not perfect, but it's getting there.
